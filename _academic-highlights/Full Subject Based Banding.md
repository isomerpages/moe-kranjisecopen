### Kranji Secondary School Full Subject-based Banding

Kranji Secondary School is one of the secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2020 onwards.  

Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOE's ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways for our students.

With Full SBB, we will move towards one secondary education, with many subject bands to better meet our students’ learning needs.
  

In 2022, Kranji Secondary School will organise Secondary 1 Form Classes in new ways, with an accompanying set of common curriculum subjects. This is on top of existing provisions to allow students to take English, Mother Tongue, Mathematics, and Science at a more demanding level from Sec 2, if they meet requirements.
