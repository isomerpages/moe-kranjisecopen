    <div>  
  
        <p> The cohort of Primary 6 pupils sitting for the PSLE this year will apply to secondary schools under a new PSLE scoring system. MOE has released the indicative entry and cut-off points for all secondary schools, based on simulated scores modelled on last year's PSLE scores.  <br><br>
  
Based on last year's PSLE scores, the range of cut-off points would be 10-14 for Express, 21-23 for Normal (Academic), and 25-27 for Normal (Technical). Please note that the cut-off points may change based on the scores of the students who apply with this year's PSLE scores.  <br><br>
  
For more information on the new PSLE scoring system, you can refer to [https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/psle/main.html](https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/psle/main.html)</p>

    <label for="accordion2">Q2. How will Full Subject-based Banding look like in Kranji Secondary? </label>  
  
    <div>  
  
      <p> Kranji Secondary School is one of the secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2020 onwards.  <br><br>
  
Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOE's ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways for our students.  <br><br>
  
With Full SBB, we will move towards one secondary education, with many subject bands to better meet our students' learning needs.  <br><br>
  
In 2022, Kranji Secondary School will organise Secondary 1 Form Classes in new ways, with an accompanying set of common curriculum subjects. This is on top of existing provisions to allow students to take English, Mother Tongue, Mathematics, and Science at a more demanding level from Sec 2, if they meet requirements.</p>
