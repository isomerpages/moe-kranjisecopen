### Meet our Principal

**A Message from our Principal, Mr Goh Soon Hoe**

<img src="/images/principal.png" style="width:183px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">  Welcome! In Kranji Secondary, our vision is to mould students into thinkers with the drive to excel, and leaders with a heart to serve, so that they can champion causes that they believe in.

We invite you to explore this site to learn more about how Kranji Secondary create the thinkers, leaders and champions of tomorrow, so that your child can benefit under our DSA programmes.Â If you have any questions, we would also like to invite you to sign up for a conversation with me on 20 May, Friday at 7 pm.

We look forward to welcoming you and your child to join our Kranjian community.
